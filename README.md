How do I approach designing software?
  Recognizing that this was all new to me, I spent my time reading the OpenGL forum to gain understanding for what I was going to be accomplishing.
  Then, I carefully read the scripted prompt from each lesson and learned what it was I was supposed to learn and accomplish. Once I understood the
  concept, I immediately applied what skill I learned to the project while it was still fresh in my mind. 

How do I approach developing programs?
  Looking back there were ways I could have better implemented iterators and other developmental stategies. What I did use, was strategies like 
  calling premade shapes and then altering them according to my needs.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  A computer science degree, although not necessary, will be a major asset in my pursuit of becoming a software engineer. I get to learn and practice
  the foundations of code and apply them in my personal projects as I continue to learn and grow. My end goal is to be a professional in the field of
  computer science.
